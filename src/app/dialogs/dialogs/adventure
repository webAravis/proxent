Player: Hey babe, you won't believe what just happened! Ryan, the famous adventurer, contacted us.

Girlfriend: Ryan? What did he want?

Player: He wants to bring Sarah along for the filming of his next adventure show.

Girlfriend: Really? That's amazing! What an opportunity for Sarah.

Player: Yeah, I know. But there's one catch. We'll have to put our project on hold for a while.

Girlfriend: How long?

Player: About two months. They'll be filming in remote locations and it will be hard for Sarah to keep up with our project at the same time.

Girlfriend: I see. Well, I think it's a great opportunity for Sarah, but we should also consider how it will impact our project.

Player: I know, but I don't want to hold Sarah back. This could be a huge stepping stone for her career.

Girlfriend: I agree. Let's talk to Sarah and see what she wants to do. We'll figure it out together.
