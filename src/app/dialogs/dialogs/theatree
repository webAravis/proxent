Player: Hey, have you heard about the offer we got for Sarah to participate in a drama?

Girlfriend: No, what offer?

Player: One of the producers we worked with saw her acting in one of our videos and thinks she would be great for their new project. They offered her a role in a drama series.

Girlfriend: Wow, that's amazing! But, isn't that against our deal?

Player: I don't think so, we're not touching her and it's not a provocative project. Plus, it's a great opportunity for her.

Girlfriend: Yeah, you're right. I think we should talk to her about it.

Player: I already did, and she seems interested. I told her we would support her if she decides to do it.

Girlfriend: Great, let's do it! It's amazing to see how our project is opening doors for all of us.
