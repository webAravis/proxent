Player: What?! Sarah got caught by the police?

Girlfriend: Yeah, she was driving too fast.

Player: That's bad news. What are we going to do?

Girlfriend: We have to pay the bribe.

Player: The bribe? Why do we have to pay a bribe?

Girlfriend: Well, the police officer who caught her is asking for a bribe. He won't let her go unless we pay him.

Player: That's outrageous! We can't just bribe the police.

Girlfriend: We don't have a choice. If we don't pay him, Sarah will end up in jail.

Player: Alright, how much does he want?

Girlfriend: He's asking for a pretty big amount. We'll have to sell some of our equipment to cover it.

Player: This is so frustrating. Why can't things just go smoothly for once?
